# Deft Hands
Provides visual feedback when picking locks in Fallout 4.

The Ticks menu indicates where your pick most recently broke and how far you have been able to rotate the lock at each angle by placing "ticks" along the circumference of the lock. When you break a pick the relevant tick doubles in length, and when you rotate the lock the relevant tick changes in color.

The Bar menu indicates the location of the sweet spot along a bar placed at the top of the screen. If both menus are active then you can switch between them at any time using the "Toggle Active" button.

Many settings can be changed at any time by editing the DeftHands.XML file.
